**Swiss**: *Putting Messaging the Hands of the Messagers*

*Swiss* is the premier peer-to-peer messaging application for absolutely isolated private conversations. Ditching the client-server-client model allows *Swiss* to offer an objective guarantee
of privacy from its creators' private eyes, and provides ample opportunity for user modifications and adjustments, giving said user the ultimate freedom in internet messaging.
*Swiss* is written in Java, meaning that it is platform-independent, and can be run on any system that has a Java 8+ Runtime Environment installed (www.java.com if you don't).
This portability makes *Swiss* criminally easy to suggest to your friends, without the need to preach to them about the importance of FOSS or the GNU way of life. 
Be it Linux, Windows, Mac, or FreeBSD, *Swiss* will run on it.
